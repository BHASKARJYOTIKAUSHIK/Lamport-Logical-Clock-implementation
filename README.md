# Lamport's Logical Clock Simulator

This project implements **Lamport's Logical Clock**, a mechanism to order events in a distributed system. The Python-based simulator allows interactive simulation of local events, message sending, and receiving across multiple processes.

---

## Features

- Simulate **Local Events** for any process.
- Simulate **Send Events** with timestamp generation.
- Simulate **Receive Events** with logical clock updates.
- **Dynamic Number of Processes** for flexibility.
- **Interactive Menu** for user control.
- Display the current state of all processes' clocks.
